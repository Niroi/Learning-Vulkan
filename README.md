# Learning Vulkan

In this project I'm studying and applying the Vulkan API to learn the ins and outs of computer graphics with a 'lean' API. Using the official [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Introduction) as guidlines.

## Requirements
Need installations of Vulkan, GLFW and a current c++ compiler, for project building CMake.

## Building project

```
mkdir build
cd build/
cmake ..
make
```
